# Cyclist bike sharing Analysis

Cyclist is a succesful bike sharing company based on chicago. 
The company wants to convert casual riders into annual riders to increase the company's profit.
As a junior data analyst my goal is to find the answer to the question how casual riders are different from annual riders.

I follow six steps of analysis that is: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act.
I have completed the whole process in the R notebook.
